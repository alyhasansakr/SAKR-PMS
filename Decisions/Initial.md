This is the set of initial decisions made right at the start of the project:
1. Project starts with basic architecture documentation in text.
2. Few basic requirements are defined in text.
3. Tests are designed to cover the basic requirements.
4. A platform is chosen for the implementation.
5. An abstract implementation of the requirements is written until all tests pass.
